Hello..
This package was supposed to contain a project where by I have an object
representing a bank account.
I wanted to make it into an array of objects allowing me to: add new accounts, update the account details
through deposits and withdrawals as well as delete the account. Till now I still havent figured out how to do this so
if you have any insights of how I can go about it, please do so and tell me.
I will continue to work on it on my side as well.
